Regarding the MoveMap Class // Could be renamed to GroupDescriptor.

There should be a MoveMap instance for every seperate group of people in a
crowd. For every group, a MoveMap instance should be created. The MoveMap should
take care of:

1. The group movement.
2. The group spawn location.
3. The number of people in the group.
4. Runtime (simulation time) source and sink.


Workflow:

1. parse map file and obtain groupdescriptors.
2. generate crowd on groupdescriptors.
3. simulate movement of crowd (using groupdescriptors).
